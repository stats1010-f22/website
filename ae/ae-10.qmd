11. An auditor inspects 25 transactions processed by the business office of a company. The auditor selects these transactions at random from the thousands that were processed in the most recent three months.

True or False: A binomial model would be more appropriate for this problem if the auditor picked the first 25 transactions during the three-month period.
12. Is the binomial model suited to these applications?

11. The currently age (in years) of 400 clerical employees at an insurance claims processing center is normally distributed with mean 38 and SD 6. True or False: A training program for employees under the age of 30 at the center would be expected to attract about 36 employees.

13. A contractor built 30 similar homes in a suburban development. The homes have comparable size and amenities, but each has features that customize the appearance, landscape, and interior.

12. A school district has requested a survey be conducted on the socioeconomic status of their students. Their budget only allows them to conduct the survey in some of the schools, hence they need to first sample a few schools. Students living in this district generally attend a school in their neighbourhood. The district is broken into many distinct and unique neighbourhoods, some including large single-family homes and others with only low-income housing. What kind of sampling did they employ?

5.  The manager of a warehouse monitors shipments. A random sample of 25 packages is selected and weighed every day. The mean weight should be $\mu = 22$ pounds, and $\sigma = 5$ pounds. True or False: An $X$-bar chart with control limits 12 pounds and 32 pounds has a 5% chance of a Type I error.

6.  Rather than stop the production when a mean crosses the control limits in the $X$-bar chart, a manager has decided to wait until two consecutive means lie outside the control limits before stopping the process. The control limits are $\mu \pm 2\sigma/ \sqrt{n}$.
