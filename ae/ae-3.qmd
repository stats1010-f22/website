# Load packages, data

```{r load-packages, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

## loading libraries
library(tidyverse) # for data analysis and visualisation
library(here) # to organize files
library(praise) # for ocassional good vibes!
library(patchwork) # to print multiple plots in one
```

# Dotplot

1.  Look at the coding below and one at a time remove each of the dotsize, alpha, stackdir, and method from the code. What does each of these inputs do? How does each input impact upon the plot?

```{r histogram_price}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| 
ggplot(data = diamonds) + # the data
  geom_dotplot(mapping = aes(x = price), # plot of price
               dotsize = 0.005, # make the dots tiny
               alpha = 0.3, # less opaque
               stackdir = "center") #
```

# Dotplot vs boxplot

A boxplot provides summary information for the distribution of a variable. Here are some explanations (using different data) showing the purpose of the box portion of the boxplot.

The left line of the box is the *lower quartile (LQ)* or *Q1*
![](ae-3-images/first_quartile.png)

```{r}
praise()
```

The middle line of the box is the *median*
![](ae-3-images/second_quartile.png)

The right line of the box is the *upper quartile (UQ)* or *Q3*
![](ae-3-images/third_quartile.png)

2.  Looking at the above plots, count the percentage of yellow dots in each of the dotplots. Is there anything interesting about these values?

3.  Compare and contrast a dotplot and a boxplot? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each? Think carefully about [bimodal data](https://openintro.shinyapps.io/ims-02-explore-02/#section-density-plots-vs.-boxplots) and which plot you would use to show that aspect of a variable. Also think about outliers.

# Boxplots

4.  Draw a boxplot of the price data from the diamonds dataset.

    ```{r boxplot_price}
    #| message: false
    #| warning: false
    #| eval: false
    #| echo: true


    ggplot(data = INSERT) + 
       INSERT(mappping = aes(x = INSERT))
    ```

## Boxplot descriptions

![](ae-3-images/skewness.png)

5.  Use the information above to describe the boxplot of price.

## Interquartile range (IQR)

The IQR of a variable is the length of the box in a boxplot. 
$$ IQR = UQ - LQ$$

    ```{r}
    praise()
    ```

# Density plot
```{r density_plot_price}
    #| message: false
    #| warning: false
    #| eval: false
    #| echo: true

 ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
       geom_density(aes(x = price), bw = 1)
    ```


6.  What does the "bw" input in the geom_density function do? What is an appropriate value of "bw" for this data?


```{r density_plot_price_facet_clarity}
    #| message: false
    #| warning: false
    #| eval: false
    #| echo: true

ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_density(aes(x = price), bw = INSERT) +
  facet_wrap(~clarity)
```

7.  What does the above plots suggest about the prices of diamonds for all levels of the variable clarity? 

8.Draw a density plot of 

```{r density_plot_price_facet_clarity}
    #| message: false
    #| warning: false
    #| eval: false
    #| echo: true

ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_density(aes(x = price), bw = INSERT) +
  facet_wrap(~INSERT)
```
