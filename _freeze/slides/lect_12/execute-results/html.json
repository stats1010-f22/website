Now is our chance!\n\nOne of the differences between statistics and machine learning - in ml not much thought of sampling.\n:::\n\n![](lect_07-images/parameter_estimate.png)\n\n# Intro {.smaller}\n\n::: notes\ndiscussions about ML versus statistics often involve this question of the sample. Often ML have a bunch of data and then perform an analysis. Statisticians like to ensure sample quality.\n\nBerkeley aressts from marijuana use. Police have to be there for crime to happen - Kristian Lum\n:::\n\n::: incremental\n-   *survey* : researchers ask questions of a subset of people who belong to a *population*.\n-   this subset of the population that reserachers ask is called the *sample*\n-   a sample is *representative* if it seeks to accurately reflect the characteristics of the larger group\n-   *bias* occurs in sampling when samples systematically omit a portion of the population\n-   *random* samples, where each unit has an equal probability of being choosen, are important\n:::\n\n#  {background-image=\"lect_12-things/predictive_policing.png\" background-size=\"contain\"}\n\n## Predictive policing\n\n::: incremental\n-   *Research question* - Can police use crime data from disparate sources to anticipate and prevent future crime?\n-   *population* - all crime\n-   *sample* - arrests recorded in police database\n-   Is this a random sample?\n-   arrests is a *surrogate* measurement because crime is hard to track\n:::\n\n#  {background-image=\"lect_12-things/oakland_usage.png\" background-size=\"contain\"}\n\n## Predictive policing\n\n::: incremental\n-   for arrests to occur police must be present\n-   some areas are over policed, so have more arrests\n-   this algorithm sends police to those areas\n-   read more [here](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2016.00960.x)\n-   use census data to predict crime instead of arrests, we may do better\n:::\n\n## Census\n\n::: incremental\n-   sample everyone in the population\n-   this is often difficult because some individuals are hard to locate, and these people *may have certain characterisitics that distinguish them from the rest of the population*\n-   Populations move so getting a perfect measure is hard.\n-   A census may be more complex than sampling\n:::\n\n#  {background-image=\"lect_12-things/illegal_immigrants.png\" background-size=\"contain\"}\n\n#  {background-image=\"lect_12-things/landon_roosevelt.png\" background-size=\"contain\"}\n\n## Landon vs Roosevelt {.smaller}\n\n::: incremental\n-   Literary digest - correctly predicted presidential elections from 1916 - 1932 with mock ballots\n-   1936 election\n    -   10 million ballots\n    -   Landon win by landslide with 57%\n-   10 million names and addresses in 1936\n-   poor people were unlikely to have phones, so they over sampled the wealthy\n-   Gallup predicted a Roosevelt win\n-   *weighting* can be used to correct *biased* samples\n:::\n\n# Sampling\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"100%\"}\n![](lect_12-things/wally-walrus-soup.gif)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"0%\"}\n:::\n:::\n\n## Sampling\n\n::: incremental\n-   tasting is analogous to *exploratory analysis*\n-   stirring helps ensure that the taste is *representative* because it *randomizes*\n-   if we add ingredients and don't stir we may get a *biased sample*\n-   if we generalize and decide that it needs more salt, that's an *inference*\n:::\n\n## Sampling frame\n\n::: incremental\n-   lists every member of the population of interest\n-   can be complex to identify\n-   sample from registered voters, but really want people who will vote\n-   hypothetical populations are more complex\n-   a brewery must sample hops across farmers, and different geographic regions prior to formalizing brewing\n:::\n\n## Simple random sample {background-image=\"lect_12-things/SRS.png\" background-size=\"contain\"}\n\n## Stratified sampling {background-image=\"lect_12-things/stratified.png\" background-size=\"contain\"}\n\n## Cluster sample {background-image=\"lect_12-things/cluster.png\" background-size=\"contain\"}\n\n## Sampling\n\n::: notes\n-   schools or nursing homes for cluster sampling\n-   strata imply some similarity, for example high income or low income people\n:::\n\n::: incremental\n-   Randomly select cases from the population, where there is no implied connection between the points that are selected.\n\n-   Strata are made up of similar observations. We take a simple random sample from each stratum.\n\n-   Clusters are usually not made up of homogeneous observations. We take a simple random sample of clusters, and then sample all observations in that cluster. Usually preferred for economical reasons.\n:::\n\n## Sampling in `R`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# SRS\ndata %>% \n  slice_sample(n = sample_size)\n\n# Stratified sampling\ndata %>% \n  group_by(strata) %>% \n  slice_sample(n = size_from_each_strata)\n\n# Cluster sampling\nrandom_cluster <- slice_sample(data$cluster, \n                               n = no_of_clusters)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Not great sampling methods\n\n::: notes\nmeta and other tech companies often use NZ as a sampling ground to see how a new product works prior to releasing it to the USA.\n\nmy cousin when she started her allergen-free cakes b/c her son couldn't eat anything\n:::\n\n::: incremental\n-   [voluntary response](https://www.birdoftheyear.org.nz/)\n-   convenience sampling - asking friends or families feedback about your product\n:::\n\n# Warnings\n\n::: incremental\n-   sampling frame match population\n-   sampling method\n-   rate of nonresponse - how many people did not answer\n-   wording of the question - do you like this class\n-   interviewer affects - you are more likely to tell Patrick that you do not like this course than me\n-   survivor bias - we don't know how students who did not stay in this class feel about it\n:::\n",
