They are descriptors or grouping factors.\n\n## The purpose of exploring categorical variables\n\n-   Exploratory Data Analysis is about learning the structure of a dataset through a series of numerical and graphical techniques.\n\n-   When you do EDA, you'll look for both\n\n    -   general trends and\n\n    -   interesting outliers in your data.\n\ngenerate questions that will help inform subsequent analysis.\n\n# Counts & proportions\n\n-   How many freshman are there in our class?\n\n-   What proportion of our class turned in the diamonds assignment?\n\n-   How many transportation stocks are in our portfolio?\n\n-   DOES NOT RESTRICT THE POPULATION\n\n-   Others?\n\n# Marginal distribution\n\n-   The count of the distribution of one variable.\n\n-   This is referred to as the marginal distribution because in a contingency table, we usually compute the column sums and row sums in the **margins**.\n\n# Conditional probabilities\n\n-   Of all the freshman students in our class what percent turned in the diamonds exercise?\n\n-   Of all the students who turned in the diamonds exercise how many were freshman?\n\n-   How many transportation stocks are in our portfolio that performed well last year?\n\n-   Of all the stocks in our portfolio that performed well last year, how many are transportation stocks?\n\n-   RESTRICTED TO A SUBPOPULATION\n\nOthers?\n\n# Words to watch for\n\n-   Mutually exclusive\n\n-   Associated\n\n-   Independence\n\n-   Chi-Squared test\n\n-   $H_0$ and $H_A$\n\n-   Contingency table\n\n# Application exercise\n\n[Click here](https://stats1010-f22.github.io/website/ae/ae-2-exploring-categorical-vars.html) or the qr code below to write your first line of code\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lect_03_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n",
