## Standard error

The formula for standard error for $\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2$ is

\begin{eqnarray*}
\sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1}+\frac{p_2(1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}
\end{eqnarray*}

We need to check 
\begin{eqnarray*}
n_1\cdot p_1 \geq 10 \\
n_1\cdot(1-p_1) \geq 10\\
n_2\cdot p_2 \geq 10\\
n_2\cdot(1-p_2) \geq 10
\end{eqnarray*}

But, we don't know $p_1$ and $p_1$. What do we do?

## Hypothesis test for a difference in proportions

In the case of hypothesis tests, as long as we are testing the hypotheses

\begin{eqnarray*}
H_0: p_1=p_2 \\
H_A: p_1 \neq p_2
\end{eqnarray*}

We approximate both $p_1$ and $p_2$ in the standard error formula with $\hat{p}$. What is $\hat{p}$?

## Pooled proportion

A pooled proportion assumes the null hypothesis is true, and there really is no difference between the proportions. The differences we observed were just due to random chance. So, we compute $\hat{p}$ as the overall proportion,

\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\text{total \# of successes}}{\text{total sample size}}
\end{eqnarray*}

Usually you can just read this off of a table. Sometimes you need a "formula,"

\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{p}=\frac{\hat{p}_1n_1+\hat{p}_2n_2}{n_1+n_2}
\end{eqnarray*}

## Hypothesis test for a difference in proportions

\begin{eqnarray*}
z = \frac{(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2)}{SE}
\end{eqnarray*}

where

\begin{eqnarray*}
\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n_1}+\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n_2}}
\end{eqnarray*}

## Example {.t}
Again, from a sample of 100 US adults, we know the following:
\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
 & Government & Private \\
Self-employed & 1 & 11 \\
Someone else & 20 & 68
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Let's test to see if the proportion of self-employed people is really different between government and private employees.
