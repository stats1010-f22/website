## Different types of comparisons

From our last lecture, there are two courses that participants can take to improve their ESP abilities. One series of courses focuses on somatic training of the participant and the other on eye contact between the sender and receiver. For the purposes of this exercise, we let S be the event that a person took the first somatic course, and I be the event that a person took the first eye training course. We follow 442 people who took one of these courses with data on their earnings from clarivoyant work. This lesson will teach us how to assess these two courses. We will answer these questions:

::: incremental
1. Does a higher proportion of people make more money after taking course I?
1. What can we say about the differences in proportions of

# Data

Let $p_i = \text{the proportion of students who continue the series of eye contact training courses}$ and  $p_s = \text{the proportion of students who continue the series of somatic training courses}$. To demonstrate that somatic course is better than the eye contact course, we want 10\% more students to reenroll. The null hypothesis is $$H_0: p_s - p_i \leq 0.1$$ 
means that enrollment in subsequent somatic courses does not meet this criteria. If the data rejects $H_0$ in favor of $H_A: p_s - p_i > 0.1$, this suggests the somatic course is better.

## Data - cont'd  

There are a few ways that we can get data to explore these hypotheses:

::: incremental
1. Experiment: random sample, assigns treatment, compares between treatments.
2. Obtain random samples from two populations.
3. Compare two sets of observations: can be problematic

## Confounding





The formula for standard error for $\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2$ is

```{=tex}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1}+\frac{p_2(1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}
\end{eqnarray*}
```
We need to check \begin{eqnarray*}
n_1\cdot p_1 \geq 10 \\
n_1\cdot(1-p_1) \geq 10\\
n_2\cdot p_2 \geq 10\\
n_2\cdot(1-p_2) \geq 10
\end{eqnarray*}

But, we don't know $p_1$ and $p_1$. What do we do?

## Hypothesis test for a difference in proportions

In the case of hypothesis tests, as long as we are testing the hypotheses


$H_0: p_1=p_2 \\
H_A: p_1 \neq p_2$

We approximate both $p_1$ and $p_2$ in the standard error formula with $\hat{p}$. What is $\hat{p}$?

## Pooled proportion

A pooled proportion assumes the null hypothesis is true, and there really is no difference between the proportions. The differences we observed were just due to random chance. So, we compute $\hat{p}$ as the overall proportion,

```{=tex}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\text{total \# of successes}}{\text{total sample size}}
\end{eqnarray*}
```
Usually you can just read this off of a table. Sometimes you need a "formula,"

```{=tex}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{p}=\frac{\hat{p}_1n_1+\hat{p}_2n_2}{n_1+n_2}
\end{eqnarray*}
```
## Hypothesis test for a difference in proportions

```{=tex}
\begin{eqnarray*}
z = \frac{(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2)}{SE}
\end{eqnarray*}
```
where

```{=tex}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n_1}+\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n_2}}
\end{eqnarray*}
```
## Example {.t}

Again, from a sample of 100 US adults, we know the following:

```{=tex}
\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
 & Government & Private \\
Self-employed & 1 & 11 \\
Someone else & 20 & 68
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
```
Let's test to see if the proportion of self-employed people is really different between government and private employees.
