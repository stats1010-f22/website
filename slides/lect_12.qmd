::: incremental
- *survey* : researchers ask questions of a subset of people who belong to a *population*.
- this subset of the population that reserachers ask is called the *sample*
- a sample is *representative* if it seeks to accurately reflect the characteristics of the larger group
- *bias* occurs in sampling when samples systematically omit a portion of the population
