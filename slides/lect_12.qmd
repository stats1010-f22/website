## Revision

::: notes
We have not yet discussed the sampling process. Now is our chance!

One of the differences between statistics and machine learning - in ml not much thought of sampling.

# Intro {.smaller}

::: notes
discussions about ML versus statistics often involve this question of the sample. Often ML have a bunch of data and then perform an analysis. Statisticians like to ensure sample quality.

:::

::: incremental
-   *survey* : researchers ask questions of a subset of people who belong to a *population*.
-   this subset of the population that reserachers ask is called the *sample*
-   a sample is *representative* if it seeks to accurately reflect the characteristics of the larger group
-   *bias* occurs in sampling when samples systematically omit a portion of the population
-   *random* samples, where each unit has an equal probability of being choosen, are important

## Predictive policing

::: incremental
-   *Research question* - Can police use crime data from disparate sources to anticipate and prevent future crime?
-   *population* - all crime
-   *sample* - arrests recorded in police database
-   Is this a random sample?
-   arrests is a *surrogate* measurement because crime is hard to track

## Predictive policing

::: incremental
-   for arrests to occur police must be present
-   some areas are over policed, so have more arrests
-   this algorithm sends police to those areas
-   read more [here](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2016.00960.x)
-   use census data to predict crime instead of arrests, we may do better
:::

## Census

::: incremental
-   sample everyone in the population
-   this is often difficult because some individuals are hard to locate, and these people *may have certain characterisitics that distinguish them from the rest of the population*
-   Populations move so getting a perfect measure is hard.
-   A census may be more complex than sampling

## Landon vs Roosevelt {.smaller}

::: incremental
- Literary digest - correctly predicted presidential elections from 1916 - 1932 with mock ballots
- 1936 election 
    - 10 million ballots
    - Landon win by landslide with 57%
- 10 million names and addresses in 1936
- poor people were unlikely to have phones, so they over sampled the wealthy
- Gallup predicted a Roosevelt win
- *weighting* can be used to correct *biased* samples

## Sampling
::: incremental
- tasting is analogous to *exploratory analysis*
- stirring helps ensure that the taste is *representative* because it *randomizes* 
- if we add ingredients and don't stir we may get a *biased sample* 
- if we generalize and decide that it needs more salt, that's an *inference*
:::

## Sampling frame

::: incremental
- lists every member of the population of interest
- can be complex to identify
- sample from registered voters, but really want people who will vote
- hypothetical populations are more complex
- a brewery must sample hops across farmers, and different geographic regions prior to formalizing brewing

## Simple random sample {background-image="lect_12-things/SRS.png" background-size="contain"}

## Stratified sampling {background-image="lect_12-things/stratified.png" background-size="contain"}

## Cluster sample {background-image="lect_12-things/cluster.png" background-size="contain"}

## Sampling

::: notes
- schools or nursing homes for cluster sampling
- strata imply some similarity, for example high income or low income people

:::

::: incremental
- Randomly select cases from the population, where there is no implied connection between the points that are selected.

- Strata are made up of similar observations. We take a simple random sample from each stratum.

- Clusters are usually not made up of homogeneous observations. We take a simple random sample of clusters, and then sample all observations in that cluster. Usually preferred for economical reasons.

## Sampling in `R`

```{r sampling_methods}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false


# SRS
data %>% 
  slice_sample(n = sample_size)

# Stratified sampling
data %>% 
  group_by(strata) %>% 
  slice_sample(n = size_from_each_strata)

# Cluster sampling
random_cluster <- slice_sample(data$cluster, 
                               n = no_of_clusters)
```

## Not great sampling methods
::: notes
meta and other tech companies often use NZ as a sampling ground to see how a new product works prior to releasing it to the USA.

:::

::: incremental
- [voluntary response](https://www.birdoftheyear.org.nz/)
- convenience sampling - asking friends or families feedback about your product
:::

# Warnings

::: incremental
- sampling frame match population
- sampling method
- rate of nonresponse - how many people did not answer
- wording of the question - do you like this class
- interviewer affects - you are more likely to tell Patrick that you do not like this course than me
- survivor bias - we don't know how students who did not stay in this class feel about it
