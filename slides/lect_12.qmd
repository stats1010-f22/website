## Revision 1

::: notes
We have not yet discussed the sampling process. Now is our chance!

One of the differences between statistics and machine learning - in ml not much thought of sampling.

# Intro

::: notes
discussions about ML versus statistics often involve this question of the sample. Often ML have a bunch of data and then perform an analysis. Statisticians like to ensure sample quality.

::: incremental
-   *survey* : researchers ask questions of a subset of people who belong to a *population*.
-   this subset of the population that reserachers ask is called the *sample*
-   a sample is *representative* if it seeks to accurately reflect the characteristics of the larger group
-   *bias* occurs in sampling when samples systematically omit a portion of the population
-   *random* samples, where each unit has an equal probability of being choosen, are important

## Predictive policing

::: incremental
-   *Research question* - Can police use crime data from disparate sources to anticipate and prevent future crime?
-   *population* - all crime
-   *sample* - arrests recorded in police database
-   Is this a random sample?
-   arrests is a *surrogate* measurement because crime is hard to track

## Predictive policing

::: incremental
-   for arrests to occur police must be present
-   some areas are over policed, so have more arrests
-   this algorithm sends police to those aread
-   read more [here](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2016.00960.x)
-   use census data to predict crime instead of arrests, we may do better
:::

## Census

::: incremental
-   sample everyone in the population
-   this is often difficult because some individuals are hard to locate, and these people *may have certain characterisitics that distinguish them from the rest of the population*
-   Populations move so getting a perfect measure is hard.
-   A census may be more complex than sampling

## Sampling
::: incremental
- tasting is analogous to *exploratory analysis*
- stirring helps ensure that the taste is *representative* because it *randomizes* 
- if we add ingredients and don't stir we may get a *biased sample* 
- if we generalize and decide that it needs more salt, that's an *inference*
