-   Know the 3 rules of independence
-   
-   Understand how independence impacts upon a joint probability distribution function

# The Sharpe Ratio

::: notes
write S(X) formula on the board

often mu and sigma are unknown parameters
:::

$$S(X) = \frac{\mu - r_f}{\sigma}$$

::: incremental
-   $r_f$ is the return on a risk-free investment
-   $\mu$ is the mean of a random variable $X$ that measures the performance of an investment
-   $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of a random variable $X$ that measures the performance of an investment
-   all inputs must be measured over the same time period (ie. yearly, monthly, ...)
:::

## Compute the Sharpe ratio

::: notes
have them go back to the previous slide and see what they got
:::

| Company   | Random Variable | Mean per month | SD    |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| Apple     | A               | 2.45%          | 13.3% |
| McDonalds | M               | 1.14%          | 6.2%  |

assume $r_f$ is the risk-free rate of interest is $0.1\%$

## Compute the Sharpe ratio

::: notes
work through it, then what if we don't know mu and sigma could we find it if we had a pdf?
:::

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: incremental
-   $$\begin{aligned}
    S(A) &= \frac{\mu - r_f}{\sigma}\\
    &= \frac{2.45 - 0.1}{13.3}\\
    &=  0.177
    \end{aligned}$$

-   $$\begin{aligned}
    S(M) &= \frac{\mu - r_f}{\sigma}\\
    &= \frac{1.14 - 0.1}{6.2}\\
    &=  0.168
    \end{aligned}$$
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
We prefer Apple because it has a higher Sharpe ratio $0.177 > 0.168$
:::
:::

## Revision 2

::: notes
find the mean, stdev, and use them to find the Sharpe ratio
:::

Instead of knowing $\mu$ and $\sigma$ we have a pdf

## The Sharpe ratio - in `R`

::: notes
Can an investor do better by diversifing the investment?

```{r mean_stdev}

# Input the data and the pdf
stock <- tibble(x = c(5, 0, -5), 
                p_x = c(0.11, 0.8, 0.09), 
                y = c(4, 0, -4), 
                p_y = c(.18, .67, .15))


Sharpe_ratio <- # name this the Sharpe ratio
  stock %>% # use the data from above
  mutate(part_mean_x = x*p_x, # find mean for each part of x

# Joint probability distributions

::: notes
What is the expected value of X + Y?

When you see two random variables you first want to think independence.

Are these variables independent or not?

-   What is the probability that $x = 0$ and $y =4$? - $11\%$

-   What is the probability that $x = 5$ and $y =4$? - $7\%$

-   What is the probability that $x = 0$ and $y =0$? - $62\%$

-   What outcome will never occur? - $x = -5$ and $y =4$
:::

## Expected value of $X + Y$

::: notes
If x=-5 then we subtract 5 from all y's and multiply by $p_{x, y}$ algebraically it all washes out

What about independence? We want to find the standard deviation to comput the Sharpe Ratio

|     |        | $X$      | $X$     | $X$     |        |
|-----|--------|----------|---------|---------|--------|

|     | $p(x)$ | $0.09$   | $0.80$  | $0.11$  | $1$    |

::: incremental
-    $E(X+Y) = E(X) + E(Y)$
-   $E(X+Y) = E(X) + E(Y) = 0.1 + 0.12 = 0.22$
:::

## 3 Rules of independence

::: notes
So are X and Y independent?
:::

If the probability of one event occuring has no impact on another event occuring, they are independent.

::: incremental
-   If $X$ and $Y$ and independent then $p(x,y) = p(x) \cdot p(y)$ for all values $(x,y)$

-   If $p(x,y) = p(x) \cdot p(y)$ for all values $(x, y)$ then $X$ and $Y$ are independent.

-   It follows that if $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then $E(XY) = E(X) \cdot E(Y)$
:::

## Are $X$ and $Y$ independent?

::: notes
find any p(x) X p(y) != p(x,y)
:::

|     |        | $X$      | $X$     | $X$     |        |
|-----|--------|----------|---------|---------|--------|
|     |        | $x = -5$ | $x = 0$ | $x = 5$ | $p(y)$ |
| $Y$ | $y=4$  | $0.00$   | $0.11$  | $0.07$  | $0.18$ |
| $Y$ | $y=0$  | $0.03$   | $0.62$  | $0.02$  | $0.67$ |
| $Y$ | $y=-4$ | $0.06$   | $0.07$  | $0.02$  | $0.15$ |
|     | $p(x)$ | $0.09$   | $0.80$  | $0.11$  | $1$    |

::: incremental
-   $p_x(-5) \cdot p_y(4) = 0.18 \cdot 0.09 \neq 0.00$

-   $p_x(-5) \cdot p_y(-4) = 0.09 \cdot 0.15 = 0.0135 \neq 0.06$

-   NO! NO! NO!
