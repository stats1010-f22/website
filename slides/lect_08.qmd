# Learning outcomes

::: incremental
By the end of this lesson you should:

-   Perform a visual assocation test

-   Know how to read a scatterplot to describe associations between quantitative variables

-   Know how to quantify associations in quantitative variables

-   Use a line to describe associations in linear relationships

-   Understand spurious correlations and lurking variables
:::

# Associations

::: notes
When have we used this word before?

Remind them of $\chi^2$ tests
:::

::: incremental
-   $\chi^2$ tests are used for associations in categorical data
-   What is used to find associations in numerical data?
:::

# Plots

::: notes
Remind them about plots of proportions that we did for titanic and comics data. What did we look for in the plots?

Which variable goes on the y axis? Which on the x axis?
:::

::: incremental
-   variable on the $y$ axis
    -   dependent
    -   response
    -   outcome
-   variable on the $x$ axis
    -   independent
    -   explanatory
    -   predictor
:::

## Price vs carat

```{r scatterplot}
diamonds %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(y = price, x = carat)) +
  labs(title = "Price vs carat", 
       x = "Carat of diamond", 
       y = "Price of diamonds in US$")
```

## Visual association test

::: notes
Ask them to run the coding in RStudio and see what they get - can connect some of their computers to the big screen

Can they see a difference between their plots and the real plot? What is the difference?

## Describing a scatter plot

::: notes
What is the difference between the actual plot and the simulated plots?

Discuss each point.

Big words make you sound smart to people that aren't that smart.
:::

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Trend or direction
    -   positive
    -   negative
-   Curvature
    -   linear
    -   nonlinear
        -   exponential
        -   quadratic
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Variation
    -   homoscedasticity (similar variance)
    -   heteroscedasticity (different variance)
-   Outliers
    -   any weird points (explore these)
-   Groupings
:::
:::

## Describe these plots

::: notes
What are the relationships between each plot?

What do the numbers mean?

:::

```{r, pairs_plots}
#| eval: true
#| message: false
#| echo: false

diamonds %>% 
  select_if(is.numeric) %>% 
  filter(y < 20, 
         z < 20, 
         table < 90) %>% 
  ggpairs(.)
```

# Measuring association

## Measuring association

::: notes
Remind them of the variance and what we did with the squares. What squares could we use now?
:::

```{r association_means}
#| eval: true
#| message: false
#| echo: false

ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_point(aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(diamonds$price),
             color = "red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(diamonds$carat),
             color = "yellow")  + # using the new names
  labs(title = "Plot of diamond price and carat with means", 
       x = "Weigh of diamond in carat", 
       y = "Price of diamonds in US$")
```

## Covariance

::: notes
If the product is negative then there it contributes to a negative trend - downhill from left to right.

Same if positive

hard to get ones that are negative for this dataset b/c tbere is a really strong positive association
:::

```{r covariance_squares}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

df <- 
  diamonds %>% 
  mutate(mean_price = mean(price), 
         mean_carat = mean(carat)) %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 10) %>% 
  select(contains(c("price","carat"))) %>% 
  mutate(diff_price = price - mean_price, 
         diff_carat = carat - mean_carat) %>% 
  mutate(indicator = 
           sign(diff_price * diff_carat)) %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(xmax = ifelse(carat < mean_carat, 
                       mean_carat, carat), 
         xmin = ifelse(carat > mean_carat, 
                       mean_carat, carat), 
         ymax = ifelse(price < mean_price, 
                       mean_price, price), 
         ymin = ifelse(price > mean_price, 
                       mean_price, price)) %>% 
  select(contains(c("max", "in"))) %>% 
  mutate(indicator = ifelse(indicator == -1, "A", "B"))
  

ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_point(aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(diamonds$price),
             color = "red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(diamonds$carat),
             color = "yellow") +
  geom_rect(data = df,
            aes(xmin = xmin, xmax = xmax, 
                ymin = ymin, ymax = ymax, 
                color = indicator, 
                fill = indicator),alpha = 0.5)
```

## Covariance math

::: notes
This is a measure of the squares. We'd like a measure that is one dimensional. We want to look at more than just squares.
:::

$cov(x, y) = \frac{(x_1 - \bar{x})(y_1 - \bar{y}) + (x_2 + \bar{x})(y_2 - \bar{y}) + \ldots + (x_n - \bar{x})(y_n - \bar{y})}{n-1}$


## Correlation math

::: notes
Standardizes the strength of the association
:::

$$corr(x, y) = \frac{cov(x, y)}{s_x, s_y}$$

## Correlation characteristics

::: notes
Standardizes the strength of the association
:::

::: incremental
1.  Referred to as $r$
2.  Strength of linear association
3.  $r$ is always between $-1$ and $+1$ $-1 \leq r \leq 1$.
4.  $r$ does not have units
:::

## Computing in `R`

::: notes
Standardizes the strength of the association
:::

```{r correlation}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

# covariance of price and carat
cov(diamonds$price, diamonds$carat)

# correlation of price and carat
cor(diamonds$price, diamonds$carat)
```

##  {background-image="lect-08_things/correlation_coef.png" background-size="contain"}

# Line of association

::: notes
What do these numbers mean?
:::

$$ y = mx + b $$

::: incremental
$m$ is gradient $b$ is the $y$ intercept
:::

## Gradient and slope

::: notes
Pull out your calculators and work on this
:::

$$ b = \frac{r \cdot s_y}{s_x} $$ $$ a = \bar{y} - b \bar{x} $$

## Fitting by hand

$r = 0.9215913$ 
$s_{price} = 3989.44$ 
$s_{carat} = 0.4740112$

::: incremental
-$$\begin{aligned}
 b &= \frac{r \cdot s_y}{s_x} \\
 &= \frac{0.9215913 \cdot 3989.44}{0.4740112} \\
 &= 7756.426
\end{aligned}$$
:::

## Fitting by hand

::: incremental
- $$\begin{aligned}
 a &= \bar{y} - b \bar{x} \\
 &= 3932.8 - 7756.426 \cdot 0.7979397\\
 &= -2256.36
\end{aligned}$$

- Our model is: $\widehat{\text{price}}  = -2256.36 + 7756.426 \cdot \text{carat}$
:::

## Prediction by hand
::: notes
Pull out your calculators and work on this
:::

for carat values $2.5$

::: incremental
- $$\begin{aligned}
\widehat{\text{price}}  &= -2256.36 + 7756.426 \cdot \text{carat} \\ 
&= -2256.36 + 7756.426 \cdot 2.5 \\
&= \$17135
\end{aligned}$$
:::


## Fit & predict in `R`

::: notes
first use of tidymodels package


:::

```{r model_fit}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| code-line-numbers: "|2|6|7|8|9|13"

# library tidymodels
library(tidymodels)

## Assign the least
## squares line
least_squares_fit <- 
  linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("lm") %>% 
  fit(price ~ carat, data = diamonds) 
## NOTE: outcome first, predictor second

## Find the prediction
predict(least_squares_fit, tibble(carat = c(1, 2, 2.5, 4)))
```

## Warnings

::: incremental
- Draw a plot first
- Numerical variables
- Linear relationship
- Check for outliers
- Lurking variables
:::

# Spurious correlations

::: incremental
-   100% of people who eat ketchup die
-   amount of sunscreen used and probability of getting skin cancer
-   birth order and probability of down syndrome
-   countries where people smoke more also have higher life expectancy
-   More shark attacks are associated with higher levels of ice cream sales.
-   The more volunteers at a natural disaster, the more destruction
