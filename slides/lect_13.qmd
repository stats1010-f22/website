# Learning outcomes

::: incremental
-   The shape of the distribution of the sample mean and why it is important
-   
-   Understand shift and scales and how to compute them to find $z$ scores
-   Basic tests of normality including qqplots and kurtosis
:::

## Sampling

::: incremental
- SRS
- Stratified sampling
- Cluster sampling
- it would be nice to sample repeatedly to see how the mean values compare

## Benefits of averaging

::: incremental
- reduces variation
- more normal than the original distribution

## Normal models
