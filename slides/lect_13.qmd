# Learning outcomes

::: incremental
-   The shape of the distribution of the sample mean and why it is important
-   
-   Understand shift and scales and how to compute them to find $z$ scores
-   Basic tests of normality including qqplots and kurtosis
:::

## Sampling

::: incremental
- SRS
- Stratified sampling
- Cluster sampling
- it would be nice to sample repeatedly to see how the mean values compare

## Benefits of averaging

::: incremental
- reduces variation
- more normal than the original distribution
:::

## Normal model

::: incremental
- Find [kurtosis](https://stats1010-f22.github.io/website/slides/lect_11.html#/kurtosis)($K_4$)
- If $n > 10 |K_4|$, where $n$ is the sample size, then a normal model adequately approximates the distribution of the sample mean $\bar{X}$.
- If we know the data come from a normal distribution this is also true.

## Standard error

$$ SD(\bar{X}) = SE(\bar{X}) = 
\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}) $$ 

## Sampling distribution

If $X \sim N(\mu_X, \sigma_X^2)$

$$ \bar{X} \sim N(\mu = \mu_X, \sigma^2 = \frac{\sigma_X^2}{n}) $$ 
## Example 

:::
1. Let $Y \sim N(\mu = 5, \sigma^2 = 16)$, find the distribution of the mean of repeated samples of size 4. 
    - $\bar{Y} \sim N(\mu = 5, \sigma^2 = 4)$
