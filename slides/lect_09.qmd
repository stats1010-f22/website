# The Sharpe Ratio

::: notes
write S(X) formula on the board

often mu and sigma are unknown parameters
:::

$$S(X) = \frac{\mu - r_f}{\sigma}$$

::: incremental
-   $r_f$ is the return on a risk-free investment
-   $\mu$ is the mean of a random variable $X$ that measures the performance of an investment
-   $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of a random variable $X$ that measures the performance of an investment
-   all inputs must be measured over the same time period (ie. yearly, monthly, ...)
:::

## Compute the Sharpe ratio

::: notes
have them go back to the previous slide and see what they got
:::

| Company   | Random Variable | Mean per month | SD    |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| Apple     | A               | 2.45%          | 13.3% |
| McDonalds | M               | 1.14%          | 6.2%  |

assume $r_f$ is the risk-free rate of interest is $0.1\%$

## Compute the Sharpe ratio

::: notes
work through it, then what if we don't know mu and sigma could we find it if we had a pdf?
:::

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: incremental
-   $$\begin{aligned}
    S(A) &= \frac{\mu_A - r_f}{\sigma_A}\\
    &= \frac{2.45 - 0.1}{13.3}\\
    &=  0.177
    \end{aligned}$$

-   $$\begin{aligned}
    S(M) &= \frac{\mu_M - r_f}{\sigma_M}\\
    &= \frac{1.14 - 0.1}{6.2}\\
    &=  0.168
    \end{aligned}$$
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
We prefer Apple because it has a higher Sharpe ratio $0.177 > 0.168$
:::
:::

## Revision 2

::: notes
find the mean, stdev, and use them to find the Sharpe ratio

put microsoft is y on the board and IBM is x

copy down the means and st deviation when they get them
:::

Instead of knowing $\mu$ and $\sigma$ we have a pdf

::: notes
What is the expected value of X + Y?

When you see two random variables you first want to think independence.

Are these variables independent or not?

:::

## Expected value of $X + Y$

::: notes
If x=-5 then we subtract 5 from all y's and multiply by $p_{x, y}$ algebraically it all washes out

What about independence? We want to find the standard deviation to compute the Sharpe Ratio
:::

::: incremental
-   $E(X+Y) = E(X) + E(Y)$
-   $E(X+Y) = E(X) + E(Y) = 0.1 + 0.12 = 0.22$
:::

# 3 Rules of independence

::: notes
So are X and Y independent?
:::

If the probability of one event occuring has no impact on another event occuring, they are independent.

::: incremental
-   If $X$ and $Y$ and independent then $p(x,y) = p(x) \cdot p(y)$ for all pairs $(x,y)$

-   If $p(x,y) = p(x) \cdot p(y)$ for all $(x, y)$ pairs, then $X$ and $Y$ are independent.

-   It follows that if $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then $E(XY) = E(X) \cdot E(Y)$
:::

## Are $X$ and $Y$ independent?

::: notes
find any p(x) X p(y) != p(x,y)

But we still need to find the stdev in order to find Sharpes ratio
:::

|     |        | $X$      | $X$     | $X$     |        |
|-----|--------|----------|---------|---------|--------|
|     |        | $x = -5$ | $x = 0$ | $x = 5$ | $p(y)$ |
| $Y$ | $y=4$  | $0.00$   | $0.11$  | $0.07$  | $0.18$ |
| $Y$ | $y=0$  | $0.03$   | $0.62$  | $0.02$  | $0.67$ |
| $Y$ | $y=-4$ | $0.06$   | $0.07$  | $0.02$  | $0.15$ |
|     | $p(x)$ | $0.09$   | $0.80$  | $0.11$  | $1$    |

::: incremental
-   $p_x(-5) \cdot p_y(4) = 0.18 \cdot 0.09 \neq 0.00$

-   $p_x(-5) \cdot p_y(-4) = 0.09 \cdot 0.15 = 0.0135 \neq 0.06$

-   NO! NO! NO!
:::

# Covariance of Random Variables

::: notes
last lesson (chpt 6) assumes that each $(x, y)$ pair appears once and are equally weighted
:::

::: incremental
-   $cov(x, y) = \frac{(x_1 - \bar{x})(y_1 - \bar{y}) + (x_2 - \bar{x})(y_2 - \bar{y}) + \ldots + (x_n - \bar{x})(y_n - \bar{y})}{n-1}$

-   assumes each $(x, y)$ pair appears once

-   $$Cov(X, Y) = E((X - \mu_X)(Y - \mu_Y))$$
:::

## Covariance of sum

::: notes
because we square things and $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab$ we have to add 2 of the covariance
:::

::: incremental
-   $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab +b^2$
-   it follows that
-   $Var(X + Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) + 2Cov(X, Y)$
:::

## Correlation {.smaller}

::: notes
what about our joint pdf? is it positively or negatively correlated? 3D plot
:::

::: incremental
-   $corr(x, y) = \frac{cov(x, y)}{s_x \cdot s_y}$

-   $$\rho = Corr(X, Y) = \frac{Cov(X, Y)}{\sigma_x \cdot \sigma_y}$$

As $X$ increases, what happens to $Y$?
:::

::: column-margin
|     |        | $X$      | $X$     | $X$     |        |
|-----|--------|----------|---------|---------|--------|
|     |        | $x = -5$ | $x = 0$ | $x = 5$ | $p(y)$ |
| $Y$ | $y=4$  | $0.00$   | $0.11$  | $0.07$  | $0.18$ |
| $Y$ | $y=0$  | $0.03$   | $0.62$  | $0.02$  | $0.67$ |
| $Y$ | $y=-4$ | $0.06$   | $0.07$  | $0.02$  | $0.15$ |
|     | $p(x)$ | $0.09$   | $0.80$  | $0.11$  | $1$    |
:::

## Independence & Cov

How does independence impact upon correlation and covariance?

$$ E((X-\mu_X)(Y-\mu_Y))$$

::: incremental
-   $$\begin{aligned}
    Cov(X,Y) &= E((X-\mu_X)(Y-\mu_Y))\\
    &= E(X - \mu_X)E(Y-\mu_Y)\\
    &= 0
    \end{aligned}$$

-   If $X$,$Y$ are independent, then $Cov(X, Y) = 0$

-   The opposite is not true (if $Cov(X, Y) = 0$, then $X$,$Y$ are independent)
:::

## Independence & Var

$Var(X) + Var(Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) + 2Cov(X, Y)$

::: incremental
-   If $X$, $Y$ are independent, $Cov(X, Y) = 0$, so

-   $$Var(X+ Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y)$$
:::

## Sharpe ratio of a sum

$$ S(X + Y) = \frac{(\mu_X + \mu_Y) - 2r_f}{\sqrt{(Var(X+Y))}} $$

## Sharpe ratio of sum - R

::: notes
What if we want to invest in two subsequent days instead of investing in two stocks for 1 day?
:::

```{r Sharpe_ratio_sum}
#| echo: true

x <- c(-5, 0, 5)

data %>% 
  mutate(cov_xy_part = (x - mu_x)*
           (y - mu_y)*probs, # multiply together
         cov_xy = sum(cov_xy_part), # sum them
         var_xy = var_x + var_y + 2*cov_xy) %>% # using the rule
  summarise(S_r = (mu_x + mu_y - 2*0.015)/
                      (sqrt(var_xy))) %>% # find the Sharpe value
  slice(1) # only the first

```

::: incremental
-   The Sharpe ratio for $X$ is $0.038$, for $Y$ it's $0.046$, investing in both gives a better return $0.050$
:::

# Double the investment

::: incremental
-   Invest twice as much for one day
-   Invest in one stock for two subsequent days
-   Which is better? Why?
:::

## Double for one day

$$S(2X) = \frac{2\mu_X - 2r_f}{\sqrt{Var(2X)}}$$

::: incremental
-   $\mu_X = 0.1$

-   $Var(X) = 4.99$

-   $r_f = .015$

-   $$\begin{aligned}
    &= \frac{2 \cdot 0.1 - 2 \cdot 0.015}{\sqrt{4 \cdot 4.99}}\\
    &= \frac{.2 - 0.03}{\sqrt{19.96}}\\
    &= 0.038
    \end{aligned}$$

-   This is the same as before, how do we compute if we invest for two subsequent days?
:::

## IID {.smaller}

If we invested in a stock on 2 subsequent days instead of investing in 2 stocks on one day the return on those two days are:

**i**ndependent and **i**dentically **d**istributed (IID)

::: incremental
-   identically distributed - the outcomes on each day are likely to be different, but the probability of the outcomes is the same

-   independent - very common assumption for stocks (part of the reason for the 2008 financial crises)
:::

## Addition rules for IID variables

::: callout-important
If $n$ random variables $(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n)$ are iid with mean $\mu_x$ and standard deviation $\sigma_x$, then

$$ E(X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n) = n \cdot \mu_x $$ $$ Var(X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n) = n \cdot \sigma^2_x $$ $$ SD(X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n) = \sqrt{n} \sigma_x $$
:::

## Sharpe ratio - two days {.smaller}

::: notes
if you decide to leave money in the bank, you may end up with a constant
:::

$$ S(X_1 + X_2) = \frac{2\mu_x - 2r_f}{\sqrt{2 \sigma^2_x}}$$

::: incremental
-   $$\begin{aligned}
    &= \frac{0.20 - 0.03}{\sqrt{9.98}}\\
    &= 0.054
    \end{aligned}$$
-   you expect more variance if you have two stock for one day b/c anything that happens that day is magnified
-   if you have one stock for two days you reduce the variance
:::

# Weighted sums

If we decide to leave money in the bank, there will be interest that accrues. How can we include this in our model?

::: callout-important
$$E(aX + bY + c) = aE(X) + bE(Y) + c$$

$$Var(aX + bY + c) = a^2Var(X) + b^2Var(Y) + 2abCov(X, Y)$$
:::

## Expectation of weighted sum

$$ E(2X + 4Y + 0.06)$$

::: incremental
-   $$\begin{aligned}
    &= 2E(X) + 4E(Y) + 0.06\\
    &= 2(0.10) + 4(0.12) + 0.06\\
    &= \$0.74
    \end{aligned}$$
:::

## Variance of weighted sum

$$ Var(2X + 4Y + 0.06)$$

::: incremental
-   $$\begin{aligned}
    &= 2^2Var(X) + 4^2Var(Y) + 2 \cdot(2 \cdot 4) \cdot Cov(X,Y)\\
    &= 4(4.99) + 16(5.27) + 16(2.19)\\
    &= 139.32
    \end{aligned}$$
