# Confidence interval for proportion

::: incremental
- What percent of customers are pleased with your service?
- What percent of customers will refinance their loans?
- What percentage of employees are in favor of a uniform change?
:::

#  {background-iframe="https://nzgwynn.shinyapps.io/CI_prop/"}

::: notes
- size of sample decreases variability
- fatter in middle, skinnier near 0 and 1
:::

## Variability

::: notes
ask them what they population mean should be

we also need to think about the variability
:::

::: incremental
- dependent on $p$ - fatter in middle, skinnier near 0 and 1
- dependent on $n$, number of samples, higher sample, less variability

:::

## Formula

$$ \hat{p} \sim N(\mu = p, \sigma^2 = \frac{p(1-p)}{n}) $$
::: incremental
- variance is like that of a Binomial distribution
-

## Example where we do this by hand

## doing it in `R`


# Confidence interval for mean

::: incremental
- example 1
- example 2
- example 3

## Building CI

## T - distribution


::: incremental
- $Z = \frac{X-\mu_X}{\sigma_X}$
- $T_{n-1} = \frac{\bar{X}-\mu_X}{S/\sqrt{n}}$

::: notes
- as df get bigger (a proxy for n) S approaches sigma
