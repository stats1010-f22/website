# Learning outcomes

::: incremental
-   Building confidence intervals for the populaiton proportion
-   Building confidence intervals for the population mean
-   Interpreting confidence intervals
-   Understand the margin of error and how to use it to compute sample sizes

## Variability

::: notes
ask them what they population mean should be

we also need to think about the variability
:::

::: incremental
- dependent on $p$ - fatter in middle, skinnier near 0 and 1
- dependent on $n$, number of samples, higher sample, less variability

:::

## Formula

$$ \hat{p} \sim N(\mu = p, \sigma^2 = \frac{p(1-p)}{n}) $$
