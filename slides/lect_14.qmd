# Confidence interval for proportion

::: incremental
-   What percent of customers are pleased with your service?
-   What percent of customers will refinance their loans?
-   What percentage of employees are in favor of a uniform change?
-   What percentage of voters will vote for Fetterman?

::: notes
-   size of sample decreases variability
-   fatter in middle, skinnier near 0 and 1
:::

## Variability

::: notes
ask them what they population mean should be

we also need to think about the variability
:::

::: incremental
-   dependent on $p$ - fatter in middle, skinnier near 0 and 1
-   dependent on $n$, number of samples, bigger sample, less variability
:::

## Variability - math

$$ \hat{p} \sim N(\mu = p, \sigma^2 = \frac{p(1-p)}{n}) $$

::: incremental
-   numerator of the variance is similar to that of a Binomial distribution
-   as sample size increases, variance decreases
:::

#  {background-iframe="https://nzgwynn.shinyapps.io/Ci_prop_with_alpha/"}

## CI - math

$$\hat{p} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})/n} $$ For $95\%$ CI, $z_{\alpha/2} = 1.96$

As confidence level increases, interval widens

In `R`: `qnorm(0.025)`

## Assumptions

::: incremental
-   *SRS condition* The observed sample is SRS from the appropriate population. If population is finite, less than 10% of total population
-   *Sample size condition (for proportion)* *both* $n\hat{p}$ and $n(1-\hat{p})$ are larger than 10.
:::

## Example 1

::: incremental
-   Let $\hat{p}= 0.14$ and $n = 350$, find a $95\%$ CI for the proportion

-   $\begin{aligned} se(\hat{p}) &= \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}} &= \sqrt{\frac{0.14(1-0.14)}{350}}\end{aligned} \approx 0.0185$

-   lower value: $\hat{p} - 1.96 \cdot 0.0185 \approx 0.10374$

-   upper value: $\hat{p} + 1.96 \cdot 0.0185 \approx 0.17626$
:::

## Example 2

An auditor checks a sample of 225 randomly chosen transactions from among the thousands processed in an office. Thirty-five contains errors in crediting or debiting the appropriate account

a\. Does this situation meet the conditions required for a $z$-interval for the proportion?

b\. Find the $95\%$ confidence interval for $p$, the proportion of all transactions processed in the this office that have these errors.

c\. Managers claim that the proportion of errors is about $10\%$. Does that seem reasonable?

## Example 2 - solns

::: incremental
a.  yes, $\hat{p} = 35/225 \approx 0.156$ so $n\hat{p}, n(1-\hat{p})> 10$ and we assume sampled $<10\%$

b.  $\begin{aligned} \hat{p} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})/n} &= 0.156 \pm 1.96 \sqrt{0.156(1-0.156)/225}\\ &= 0.156 \pm 1.96 \cdot 0.0242 \\ &= 0.156 \pm 0.047\\ & [0.109, 0.203]\end{aligned}$

c.  No $10\%$ is too low, with $95\%$ confidence it is higher

## Variability

::: notes
-   to account for smaller sample size we use a different distribution
:::

::: incremental
-   standard deviation of distribution
    -   higher sd -\> wider CI
-   sample size
    -   smaller sample size -\> wider CI
:::

##  {background-iframe="https://nzgwynn.shinyapps.io/t-distribution/"}

::: notes
-   t distribution more density in tails
:::

## CI - mean

$$\bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha/2, n-1} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} $$

## T - distribution

::: notes
-   don't know sigma so use s in it's place
-   as df get bigger (a proxy for n) S approaches sigma
:::

::: incremental
-   $Z = \frac{X-\mu_X}{\sigma_X}$
-   $\bar{X} \sim N(\mu = \mu\_X, \sigma^2 = \frac{\sigma_X^2}{n})$
-   $T_{n-1} = \frac{\bar{X}-\mu_X}{S/\sqrt{n}}$
-   $t$ distribution has more density in the tails to account for smaller sample sizes
:::

## Variability

::: incremental
-   dependent on $confidence \text{ }level$ - as confidence level increases so does the width of the interval
-   dependent on $n$, number of samples, bigger sample, less variability
:::

## Assumptions

::: incremental
-   *SRS condition* The observed sample is SRS from the appropriate population. If population is finite, less than 10% of total population
-   *Sample size condition* the sample size is larger than 10 times the absolute value of the [kurtosis](https://stats1010-f22.github.io/website/slides/lect_11.html#/kurtosis), $n>10|K_4|$.
:::

## Example 1

::: incremental
-   Let $\bar{x}= \$3285$, $n = 150$, and $s = \$238$ find a $95\%$ CI for the mean

-   $\begin{aligned} se(\bar{x}) &= s/\sqrt{n} &= 238/\sqrt{150}\end{aligned} \approx 19.43262$

-   `qt(.025, df = 149)` $\approx -1.976$

-   lower value: $3285 - 1.976 \cdot 19.43262 \approx \$3,320$

-   upper value: $3285 + 1.976 \cdot 19.43262 \approx \$3,247$

-   `3285 + qt(.025, df = 149)* 238/sqrt(150)`
:::

## Example 2

Office administrators claim that the average amount on a purchase order is \$6,000. A SRS of 49 purchase orders averages $\bar{x} = \$4,200$ with $s = \$3,500$.

a.  What is the relevant sampling distribution?
b.  Find the 95% confidence interval for $\mu$, the mean of purchase orders handled by this office during the sampling period.
c.  Do you think the administrators claim is reasonable?

## Example 2 - solns

::: incremental
a.  $N(\mu, \sigma^2/49)$

b.  $$\begin{aligned} 4200 \pm 2.01 \cdot 3500/\sqrt{49} &= 4200 \pm 2.01 \cdot 500 \\ &= 4200 \pm -1005.317 \\ &\approx [3195, 5205]\end{aligned}$$

c.  No $\$6,00$ is way above the $95\%$ confidence interval
:::

# Interpreting CI

"We can be *95% confident* that the *average purchase order* handled by *this office* lies between \$3195 and \$5205."

# Manipulating CI

In example from means. How could we update the CI if we know we had 10 offices with similar purchase patterns.

::: incremental
-   If $[L \text{ to } U]$ is a $100(1 – \alpha)%$ confidence interval for $\mu$

-   then $[c \cdot L \text{ to } c \cdot U]$ is a $100 (1 – \alpha)%$ confidence interval for $c \cdot \mu$

-   and $[c + L \text{ to } c + U]$ is a $100(1 – \alpha)%$ confidence interval for $c + \mu$.
:::

## Example 2 - solns

$10 \cdot [3195, 5205] = [31950, 52050]$

# Margin of error

$$\bar{x} \pm \frac{2s}{\sqrt{n}} $$

::: incremental
-   Margin of error = $\frac{2s}{\sqrt{n}}$
:::

## Sample size - mean

$$n = \frac{4s^2}{\text{(Margin of error)}^2} $$

::: incremental
-   For $p$ use $p = 0.5$ for biggest variance
