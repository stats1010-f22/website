# Learning outcomes

By the end of this lesson you should:

-   Understand measures of center and know how to compute them

-   Understand measures of spread and know how to compute them

-   Graphical representation and interpretation of one numerical variables in R

## Definition of numerical variable

A numerical or quantitative variable is a variable that can be measured.

## The purpose of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-   EDA is about learning the structure of a dataset through a series of numerical and graphical techniques.

-   When you do EDA, you'll look for both

    -   general trends and

    -   interesting outliers in your data.

generate questions that will help inform subsequent analysis.

# Measures of center

-   mean

-   median

-   mode

# Mean

the sum of one variables
