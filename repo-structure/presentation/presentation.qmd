## A statement of the overall goal / research question

Our project will demonstrate that the `praise` package is by far the best `R` package.

-   The presentation is created using the `quarto` package

-   Use `##` or `#` to start a new slide

# Code

```{r boring-regression}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

# a boring regression
model <- lm(price ~ carat, data = diamonds)
```

# Plots

```{r diamonds_modified}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

# In this chunk I'm doing a bunch of analysis that I don't want to present 
# in my slides. But I need the resulting data frame for a plot I want to present.
diamonds_modified <- 
    diamonds %>%
    group_by(cut, color) %>%
    mutate(sum_cut_color_x = sum(x))
```

```{r plot-diamonds_modified}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

# Code hidden with echo: FALSE
# Uses modified titanic dataset from previous chunk
# Play around with height and width until you're happy with the look
ggplot(data = diamonds_modified, 
       mapping = aes(x = carat, 
                     y = price, 
                     color = sum_cut_color_x)) +
  geom_point() + 
  theme_minimal() # theme options: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html
```

# Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r head-diamonds}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
kable(head(diamonds), format = "html")
```

# Some text {background-image="https://www.purina.com.au/-/media/project/purina/main/breeds/dog/dog_boston-terrier_desktop.jpg?h" background-size="cover"}

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. \$\alpha+\beta\$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

    $$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1.  The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

2.  There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`..

# Feeling adventurous?

-   Want to find out more about `quarto`? See https://quarto.org/.

-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. This provides some solutions for this that: https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html.
