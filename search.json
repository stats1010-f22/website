    "text": "Hat Matrix & Leverage\nRecall from the notes Matrix Form of Linear Regression that \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\) can be written as the following:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{Y}\n\\tag{5}\\]\nCombining Equation 4 and Equation 5, we can write \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}\\) as the following:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} &= \\mathbf{X}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} \\\\[10pt]\n&= \\mathbf{X}(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{Y}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{6}\\]\nWe define the hat matrix as an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix of the form \\(\\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{X}(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\). Thus Equation 6 becomes\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} = \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{Y}\n\\tag{7}\\]\nThe diagonal elements of the hat matrix are a measure of how far the predictor variables of each observation are from the means of the predictor variables. For example, \\(h_{ii}\\) is a measure of how far the values of the predictor variables for the \\(i^{th}\\) observation, \\(x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \\ldots, x_{ip}\\), are from the mean values of the predictor variables, \\(\\bar{x}_1, \\bar{x}_2, \\ldots, \\bar{x}_p\\). In the case of simple linear regression, the \\(i^{th}\\) diagonal, \\(h_{ii}\\), can be written as\n\\[\nh_{ii} =  \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n}(x_j-\\bar{x})^2}\n\\]\nWe call these diagonal elements, the leverage of each observation.\nThe diagonal elements of the hat matrix have the following properties:\n\n\\(0 \\leq h_ii \\leq 1\\)\n\\(\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} h_{ii} = p+1\\), where \\(p\\) is the number of predictor variables in the model.\nThe mean hat value is \\(\\bar{h} = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} h_{ii}}{n} = \\frac{p+1}{n}\\).\n\nUsing these properties, we consider a point to have high leverage if it has a leverage value that is more than 2 times the average. In other words, observations with leverage greater than \\(\\frac{2(p+1)}{n}\\) are considered to be high leverage points, i.e. outliers in the predictor variables. We are interested in flagging high leverage points, because they may have an influence on the regression coefficients.\nWhen there are high leverage points in the data, the regression line will tend towards those points; therefore, one property of high leverage points is that they tend to have small residuals. We will show this by rewriting the residuals from Equation 4 using Equation 7.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{e} &= \\mathbf{Y} - \\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} \\\\[10pt]\n& = \\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{Y} \\\\[10pt]\n&= (1-\\mathbf{H})\\mathbf{Y}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{8}\\]\nNote that the identity matrix and hat matrix are idempotent, i.e. \\(\\mathbf{I}\\mathbf{I} = \\mathbf{I}\\), \\(\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{H}\\). Thus, \\((\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{H})\\) is also idempotent. These matrices are also symmetric. Using these properties and Equation 8, we have that the variance-covariance matrix of the residuals \\(\\boldsymbol{e}\\), is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nVar(\\mathbf{e}) &= \\mathbf{e}\\mathbf{e}^T \\\\[10pt]\n&=  (1-\\mathbf{H})Var(\\mathbf{Y})^T(1-\\mathbf{H})^T \\\\[10pt]\n&= (1-\\mathbf{H})\\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-\\mathbf{H})^T  \\\\[10pt]\n&= \\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-\\mathbf{H})(1-\\mathbf{H})  \\\\[10pt]\n&= \\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-\\mathbf{H})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{9}\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}e_i^2}{n-p-1}\\) is the estimated regression variance. Thus, the variance of the \\(i^{th}\\) residual is \\(Var(e_i) = \\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-h_{ii})\\). Therefore, the higher the leverage, the smaller the variance of the residual. Because the expected value of the residuals is 0, we conclude that points with high leverage tend to have smaller residuals than points with lower leverage."

    "text": "Maximum Likelihood Estimation of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma\\)\nTo understand the formulas for AIC and BIC, we will first briefly explain the likelihood function and maximum likelihood estimates for regression.\nLet \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) be \\(n \\times 1\\) matrix of responses, \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), the \\(n \\times (p+1)\\) matrix of predictors, and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\), \\((p+1) \\times 1\\) matrix of coefficients. If the multiple linear regression model is correct then,\n\\[\n\\mathbf{Y} \\sim N(\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma^2)\n\\tag{1}\\]\nWhen we do linear regression, our goal is to estimate the unknown parameters \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) from Equation 1. In Matrix Notation for Multiple Linear Regression, we showed a way to estimate these parameters using matrix alegbra. Another approach for estimating \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) is using maximum likelihood estimation.\nA likelihood function is used to summarise the evidence from the data in support of each possible value of a model parameter. Using Equation 1, we will write the likelihood function for linear regression as\n\\[\nL(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{Y}|\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma^2) = \\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n (2\\pi \\sigma^2)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\exp\\bigg\\{-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n(Y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(Y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta})\\bigg\\}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere \\(Y_i\\) is the \\(i^{th}\\) response and \\(\\mathbf{X}_i\\) is the vector of predictors for the \\(i^{th}\\) observation. One approach estimating \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) is to find the values of those parameters that maximize the likelihood in Equation 2, i.e. maximum likelhood estimation. To make the calculations more manageable, instead of maximizing the likelihood function, we will instead maximize its logarithm, i.e. the log-likelihood function. The values of the parameters that maximize the log-likelihood function are those that maximize the likelihood function. The log-likelihood function we will maximize is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\log L(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{Y}|\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma^2) &= \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n -\\frac{1}{2}\\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2) -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n(Y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(Y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta}) \\\\\n&= -\\frac{n}{2}\\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2) - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{3}\\]\n\nThe maximum likelihood estimate of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) are \\[\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{Y} \\hspace{10mm} \\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{1}{n}(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = \\frac{1}{n}RSS\n\\tag{4}\\]\nwhere \\(RSS\\) is the residual sum of squares. Note that the maximum likelihood estimate is not exactly equal to the estimate of \\(\\sigma^2\\) we typically use \\(\\frac{RSS}{n-p-1}\\). This is because the maximum likelihood estimate of \\(\\sigma^2\\) in Equation 4 is a biased estimator of \\(\\sigma^2\\). When \\(n\\) is much larger than the number of predictors \\(p\\), then the differences in these two estimates are trivial."

It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or predictors). More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or ‘criterion variable’) changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed.”\n\n\nSource: Wikipedia"

(note: please look at both of the next two blocks of code.)\n\ncomics %>% \n  count(Publisher, Alignment) %>% # counts all combinations\n  View()\n\n\nThe long format above is difficult to see clearly. The format we normally use for contingency tables is the wide format.\nThe third line of coding below takes a long table and makes it wide by moving the Alignment variable to the columns, and filling the values of the table with the count variable (n). The names_from argument tells R where the names of the new columns are coming from (i.e. what variable), and the values_from argument tells R where the values in the table are coming from. Here, the values we want in our table are stored as a variable labeled n in our table.\n\ncomics %>% \n  count(Publisher, Alignment) %>%  # counts all combinations\n  pivot_wider(names_from = Alignment, \n              values_from = n) # pivots from long to wide \n\n\nThere are about ___ good superheros for each bad superhero.\n\nggplot(data = comics) + # the dataset\n  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = Alignment)) # a bar chart of Alignment\n\nLook at the next two plots and find the difference between them. What would make you use one plot over the other? Which plot shows that females are much more likely to be good superheros than bad? Which one shows that good superheros are more likely to be missing gender? And which that females are more likely to be good superheros than males? All of these mean that the variables gender and alignment are associated, the value of one impacts upon the value of the other.\n\nggplot(data = comics) + # add the data\n  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = Gender, # bar chart of gender\n                         fill = Alignment)) +  # colored by alignment\n  labs(title = \"Gender colored with alignment\") # add title\n\n\nggplot(data = comics) + # add the data\n  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = Alignment, # bar chart of alignment\n                         fill = Gender)) + # colored by gender\n  labs(title = \"Alignment colored with gender\")  # add title\n\n\nWe note that the commonly held belief that gender is binary is no longer the scientific consensus and that gender is a complex spectrum.\n\nStatisticians want to discuss the strength of association of variables. They want to ensure that this association is not the result of random noise, but instead is a function of the underlying population of interest (all superheros).\n\npraise()\n\n\n\nChi-Squared test\nTo test for independence in 2 categorical variables, statisticians use a Chi-squared test. This is a hypothesis test so it has both a null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) and an alternative hypothesis (\\(H_A\\)).\n\\(H_0\\) = the variables are independent, there is no relationship between the two categorical variables.\n\\(H_A\\) = Knowing the value of one variable helps to predict the value of the other variable\nJust like a fair court case, where a defendant is assumed to be innocent until proven guilty, here we assume \\(H_0\\) until proven otherwise. The proof that we present at the case is a formula relating the actual values in our sample to what we would expect to get under the independence assumption.\nTo perform a Chi-squared test of independence on gender and alignment we must find the marginal distributions of both gender and alignment.\n\n\nMarginal distribution\n\nThe marginal distribution is the count of each variable.\n\ncomics %>% \n  count(Alignment, Gender) %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = Alignment, \n              values_from = n)\n\n\nWe take the original two-way table (with two categorical variables) and added up the cells across each level of align (ie \\(1+7+19+2 = 29\\)) to get the marginal distribution for each variable.\n\ncomics %>% # the dataset\n  count(Gender) # and marginal distribution of gender\n\n\npraise()\n\n\ncomics %>% # the dataset\n  count(Alignment) # and marginal distribution of the Alignment\n\nIf these are independent, we would expect \\(\\frac{200}{29+200+505}\\) of the \\(207\\) (about \\(56.4\\)) bad superheros to be female, and the same proportion of \\(496\\) (about \\(135.1\\)) good superheros to be female, and so on.\n\nAssuming independence of Alignment and Gender, how many good superheros would we expect to be male? (hint: use the “$$” to make\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\))\n\nMore information, including mathematical notation can be found here.\nFortunately, `R` does all of this for us.\n\n# the \"$\" sign pulls out the Gender values and Alignment value from the comics dataset\nchisq.test(comics$Gender, comics$Alignment)\n\nWe get a warning because the missing values (“-”) expected counts are probably quite small. You can safely use the chi-square test with critical values from the chi-square distribution when no more than 20% of the expected counts are less than \\(5\\) and all individual expected counts are 1 or greater. In particular, all four expected counts in a \\(2 \\times 2\\) table should be 5 or greater.\n\npraise()\n\nThe \\(p-value\\) for this test \\(0.0003298\\) is very small which means that we have very strong evidence against \\(H_0\\) — that there is independence between Alignment and Gender — and we can reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that the association between Gender and Alignment is not likely due to chance.\n\nThere are a few characters with missing data “-” in the Alignment and Gender variables? How many are in each?\n\ncomics %>% \n  INSERT_FUNCTION(INSERT_VARIABLE)\n\n\ncomics %>% \n  INSERT_FUNCTION(INSERT_VARIABLE)\n\nSince there are only a few missing values (<10%) in each category, there is no reason to keep them especially since our analysis is largely about these two variables.\nWhat does the “!=” operator do?\n\ncomics_filtered <- # assign a name to a new dataset\n  comics %>% # tell R which dataset to start with\n  INSERT_FUNCTION(Alignment != \"-\", # remove \"-\" values in Alignment\n                  Gender != \"-\") # remove \"-\" values in Gender\n\nRemake the “Alignment colored with gender” plot and the “Gender colored with alignment” plots with this new dataset.\nRedo the Chi-Squared test for independence between Alignement and Gender. Include all hypotheses, and computations for at least \\(2\\) expected values. Does this change our conclusion?\n\npraise()\n\nSide-by-side barcharts allow us to represent the counts from a contingency table graphically. Telling R to make a side-by-side barchart involves adding the words position = \"dodge” to the coding from above. Now created the other bar chart side-by-side, the “Gender colored with alignment.” use the comics_filter dataset.\n\nggplot(data = INSERT) + # add the data\n  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = INSERT, # bar chart of alignment\n                         fill = INSERT), # colored by gender\n           position = INSERT) + # side_by_side\n  labs(title = \"Alignment colored with gender\")  # add title\n\n\n\n\nProportions\nWe have been focusing mostly on counts. Proportional data is also interesting to explore and it is easy to get R to produce those for us.\n\nWhat combination of Gender and Alignment has the highest proportion? What is the value? What is the sum of all of the proportions in the table below? (Note: Use the View() function to go through each line of code and ensure you know what each step does.)\n\ncomics %>% # which dataset to use \n  count(Gender, Alignment) %>% # counts all combinations\n  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) %>% # finds proportions\n  select(Gender, Alignment, prop) %>% # selecting which cols to pivot\n  pivot_wider(names_from = Alignment, # the variable to pivot\n              values_from = prop) # which values to pivot\n\n\n\n\nConditional proportions\n\nIf we’re curious about systematic associations between variables, we should look to conditional proportions. An example of a conditional proportion is the proportion of female superheroes that are good. To build a table of these conditional proportions, we need to specify a grouping variable before we calculate the proportions. What proportion of female characters are good? What do the rows sum to? (Note: Use the View() function to go through each line of code and ensure you know what each step does.)\n\ncomics %>% # which dataset to use \n  count(Gender, Alignment) %>% # counts all combinations\n  group_by(Gender) %>% # conditions on gender\n  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) %>% # finds proportions\n  select(Gender, Alignment, prop) %>%  # selecting which cols to pivot\n  pivot_wider(names_from = Alignment, # the variable to pivot\n              values_from = prop) # which values to pivot\n\nWhat proportion of good characters are male? What do the columns sum to?\n\ncomics %>% # which dataset to use \n  count(Gender, Alignment) %>% # counts all combinations\n  group_by(Alignment) %>% # conditions on gender\n  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) %>% # finds proportions\n  select(Gender, Alignment, prop) %>%  # selecting which cols to pivot\n  pivot_wider(names_from = Alignment, # the variable to pivot\n              values_from = prop) # which values to pivot\n\n\npraise()\n\nPlotting proportions is similar to the side-by-side bar chart completed earlier. Instead of position = \"dodge\" we use position = \"fill\" . Draw one such plot below using Gender for the x axis and color it using Alignment.\n\nggplot(data = INSERT) + # add the data\n  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = INSERT, # bar chart of ?\n                         fill = INSERT), # colored by ?\n           position = INSERT) # fill\n\nNow, change the label of the y axis from count by including the coding\nlabs(y = \"Proportion of superheroes\")\n\npraise()\n\nDoes the above plot condition on gender or alignment? How do you know? (hint: what sums to 1?)\nCondition on the other variable.\n\nggplot(data = INSERT) + # add the data\n  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = INSERT, # bar chart of ?\n                         fill = INSERT), # colored by ?\n           position = INSERT)  + # fill\n  lab(y = \"INSERT Y AXIS TITLE HERE\")\n\nAnother way to view the differences in variables is to facet. What is the advantage of a facet plot over a stacked barchart?\n\nggplot(comics) + # which dataset\n  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = Gender)) + # bar chart of Gender\n  facet_wrap(~Alignment) # broken down by Alignment"

    "title": "The birthday simulation (AE-5)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Computers let you assemble, manipulate, and visualize data sets, all at speeds that would have wowed yesterday’s scientists. In short, computers give you superpowers! But if you wish to use them, you’ll need to pick up some programming skills. Steve Job said that “computers are bicycles for our minds” because the efficiency rating of humans on bicycles is so incredible, and computers give us similar powers.\nOne reason computers are so incredible is that they allow us to simulate a multitude of events. Today we will simulate the probability that two of you in this section of Stat1010 have the same birthdays.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse) # for data manipulation\nlibrary(vctrs) # to find the length of a tibble\n\nSuppose you are in a classroom with 100 people. If we assume this is a randomly selected group of 100 people, what is the chance that at least two people have the same birthday? Although it is somewhat advanced, we can deduce this mathematically. We will do this later. Here we use a Monte Carlo simulation. For simplicity, we assume nobody was born on February 29. This actually doesn’t change the answer much.\nFirst, note that birthdays can be represented as numbers between 1 and 365, so a sample of 100 birthdays can be obtained like this:\n\nall_bdays <- as_tibble(1:365) # data from where we can sample\n\nbdays_class <- \n  all_bdays %>% # data from where to sample\n  sample_n(size = 100, replace = TRUE) # sample of size 100 with replacement\n\nTo check if in this particular set of 100 people we have at least two with the same birthday, we can use the functions group_by and filter, which returns a tibble with a vector of duplicated dates. Here is an example:\n\nbdays_class %>% \n  group_by(value) %>% # for each birthday\n  count() %>% # count them\n  filter(n > 1) # those have more than 1\n\nTo estimate the probability of a shared birthday in the group, we repeat this experiment by sampling sets of 100 birthdays over and over. Prior to replicating, we need to write this as a function.\n\nbdays_dups <- \n  all_bdays %>% # data from where to sample\n  sample_n(size = 100, replace = TRUE) %>% # take a sample of size 100\n  group_by(value) %>% # for each birthday\n  count() %>% # count them\n  filter(n > 1) %>% # those have more than 1\n  vec_size(.) # the number that are duplicated\n\nA function has an input (in this case \\(n\\))\n\nWhat does \\(n\\) represent in this coding?\n\n\nnum_of_same_birthdays <- function(n){\n  all_bdays %>% # data from where to sample\n  sample_n(size = n, replace = TRUE) %>% # take a sample\n  group_by(value) %>% # for each birthday\n  count() %>% # count them\n  filter(n > 1) %>% # those have more than 1\n  vec_size(.) # the number that are duplicated\n}\n\nTo run this function, we do this:\n\nnum_of_same_birthdays(10) # run the function\n\n\nHow many students are there in class today?\nRun the coding above but include the number of students in class today.\n\nThe law of large numbers says that if we do this many times we should have an estimate of the number of people that have the same birthdays in class today. The function replicate can be used to run functions multiple times.\n\nB <- 10000 # the number of times to run\nresults <- replicate(B, # replicate this number of times\n          num_of_same_birthdays(INSERT)) # our function\n\nmean(results) # take the mean\n\nWere you expecting the probability to be this high?\nPeople tend to underestimate these probabilities. To get an intuition as to why it is so high, think about what happens when the group size is close to 365. At this stage, we run out of days and the probability is one.\nSay we want to use this knowledge to bet with friends about two people having the same birthday in a group of people. When are the chances larger than 50%? Larger than 75%?\nLet’s create a look-up table. We can create a function to compute this for any group size. This function runs our function \\(10000\\) times for every value of \\(n\\).\n\ncompute_prob <- # name the function\n  function(n, B = 10000){ # function inputs\n  results <- # store results\n    replicate(B, # run num_of_same_birthdays B times \n              num_of_same_birthdays(n)) # for the value of n\n  \n  mean(results) # find the mean\n}\n\nUsing the function map_dbl, we can perform element-wise operations on any function. Note that this may take awhile to run.\n\nn <- seq(1, 60) # which values of n are important\nprob <- # save the results as prob\n  map_dbl(n,  # for each value of n \n          compute_prob) # run the function\n\nWe can now make a plot of the estimated probabilities of two people having the same birthday in a group of size n:\n\nas_tibble(n, prob) %>% # the format for ggplot\n  ggplot() + # draw a graph\n  geom_point(aes(x = n, y = prob)) # of points\n\nNow let’s compute the exact probabilities rather than use Monte Carlo approximations. Not only do we get the exact answer using math, but the computations are much faster since we don’t have to generate experiments.\nTo make the math simpler, instead of computing the probability of it happening, we will compute the probability of it not happening, or the compliment. For this, we use the multiplication rule.\nLet’s start with the first person. The probability that person 1 has a unique birthday is 1. The probability that person 2 has a unique birthday, given that person 1 already took one, is 364/365. Then, given that the first two people have unique birthdays, person 3 is left with 363 days to choose from. We continue this way and find the chances of all \\(n\\) people having a unique birthday is:\n\\[1×\\frac{364}{365}×\\frac{363}{365}…\\frac{365−n+1}{365}\\] We can write a function that does this for any number:\n\nexact_prob <- function(n){\n  1 - \n    prod(365:(365-n+1))/ # the product from the numerator above\n    365^(n) # the denominator from above\n}\n\n\nRun this coding for the number of people that are in class today.\n\nNow, we run this on multiple values of \\(n\\)\n\neprob <- map_dbl(n, exact_prob) # run on multiple values of n\n\nNext we plot the results.\n\nas_tibble(n, eprob) %>% # the format for ggplot\n  ggplot() + # draw a graph\n  geom_point(aes(x = n, y = eprob)) # of points\n\nOn mercury, the year is only 88 days. Update the coding above to simulate the expected number of people with the same birthdays on Mercury.\nAssuming we have the same number of people, would you expect the number of people with the same birthdays to be higher or lower than those on earth?"

All team members should contribute to the GitHub repository, with regular meaningful commits.\nBefore you finalize your write up, make sure the printing of code chunks is off with the option echo = FALSE.\nYou will submit the PDF of your final report on Gradescope.\nThe PDF you submit must match the files in your GitHub repository exactly. The mandatory components of the report are below. You are free to add additional sections as necessary. The report, including visualizations, should be no more than 10 pages long. is no minimum page requirement; however, you should comprehensively address all of the analysis and report.\nBe selective in what you include in your final write-up. The goal is to write a cohesive narrative that demonstrates a thorough and comprehensive analysis rather than explain every step of the analysis.\nYou are welcome to include an appendix with additional work at the end of the written report document; however, grading will largely be based on the content in the main body of the report. You should assume the reader will not see the material in the appendix unless prompted to view it in the main body of the report. The appendix should be neatly formatted and easy for the reader to navigate. It is not included in the 10-page limit.\nThe written report is worth 40 points, broken down as follows\n\n\n\nTotal\n40 pts\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction/data\n6 pts\n\n\nMethodology\n10 pts\n\n\nResults\n14 pts\n\n\nDiscussion + conclusion\n6 pts\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\n4 pts\n\n\n\nClick here for a PDF of the written report rubric.\n\nIntroduction and data\nThis section includes an introduction to the project motivation, data, and research question. Describe the data and definitions of key variables. It should also include some exploratory data analysis. All of the EDA won’t fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe research question and motivation are clearly stated in the introduction, including citations for the data source and any external research. The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables. It incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\n\n\n\nMethodology\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process. Explain the reasoning for the type of model you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final model; the approach is clearly described in the report. The model selection process took into account potential interaction effects and addressed any violations in model conditions. The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model. If violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n\n\nResults\nThis is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics.\nDescribe the key results from the model. The goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described. Interpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient. If the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model’s predictive power is thoroughly assessed.\n\n\n\nDiscussion + Conclusion\nIn this section you’ll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved. Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. Lastly, this section will include ideas for future work.\n\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the model results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\n\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted. All citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 10 pages."

You all belong here. It is also my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity and in alignment with Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at the Wharton School. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups. Please feel free to leave anonymous comments in my mailbox on the 4th floor of the Academic Research Building.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me or a member of the teaching team know.\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nIf there is any portion of the course that is not accessible to you due to challenges with technology or the course format, please let me know so we can make appropriate accommodations.\nThe Weingarten Center is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments. Students should be in touch with the the Weingarten Center to request or update accommodations under these circumstances; it can take up to 4 weeks to review documents and get approval.\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the course website at stats1010-f22.github.io/website.\nI will regularly send course announcements via email and canvas, make sure to check one or the other of these regularly. If an announcement is sent Monday through Thursday, I will assume that you have read the announcement by the next day. If an announcement is sent on a Friday or over the weekend, I will assume that you have read it by Monday.\n\n\nWhere to get help\n\nIf you have a question during lecture, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.\nThe teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend office hours to ask questions about the course content and assignments. Many questions are most effectively answered as you discuss them with others, so office hours are a valuable resource. Please use them!\nOutside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on the Ed discussion forum. There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts in Conversations before adding a new question. If you know the answer to a question posted in the discussion forum, I encourage you to respond!\nEmails should be reserved for questions not appropriate for the public forum. If you email me, please include “STAT 1010” in the subject line and ONLY STAT 1010. Barring extenuating circumstances, I will respond to STAT 1010 emails within 48 hours Monday - Friday. Response time may be slower for emails sent Friday evening - Sunday.\n\nCheck out the Support page for more resources."

A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture and lab. You are expected to attend all lecture and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion. Additionally, some lectures will feature application exercises that will be graded. In addition to application exercises will be periodic activities to help build a learning community. These will be short, fun activities that will help everyone in the class connect throughout the semester.\nYou are expected to bring a laptop to each class so that you can take part in the in-class exercises. Please make sure your laptop is fully charged before you come to class as the number of outlets in the classroom will not be sufficient to accommodate everyone.

These exercises give you an opportunity to apply the statistical concepts and code introduced in the readings and lectures. Due dates for AEs will be announced as they are assigned.\nBecause these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on completion, i.e., a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts. Successful on-time completion of at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.\n\n\nHomework\nIn homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Similar to lab assignments, homework must be typed up using Quarto and submitted as a PDF in Canvas.\nOne homework assignment will be dedicated to a statistics experience. The statistics experience is an opportunity to engage with statistics and data science outside of the classroom through podcasts, books, seminars, data analysis competitions, and other activities. As you complete these experiences, the goal is to consider how the material you’re learning in the course connects with society more broadly.\nThe lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nExams\nThere will be four exams consisting of multiple choice questions. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far. The exams will focus on the conceptual understanding of the content. The content of the exam will be related to the content in the prepare, practice, and perform assignments. More detail about the exams will be given during the semester.\nThe lowest exam grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nProject\nThe purpose of the project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting, data-driven research question. The project will be completed with your teams, and each team will present their work. More information about the project will be provided during the semester."

Your TA and I will help you be providing you with materials and answering questions and setting a pace, but for this to work you must do the following:\n\nComplete all the preparation work before class.\nAsk questions. As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TA, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you’re not sure about the homework, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo the readings.\nDo the homework and lab.The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example.)\nDon’t procrastinate. If something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, and eventually you won’t know where to begin asking questions. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours, and let me help you identify a good (re)starting point."

    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic integrity\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\nAll students must adhere to Wharton’s Code of Academic Integrity: Wharton is a community dedicated to scholarship, leadership, and service and to the principles of honesty, fairness, and accountability. Citizens of this community commit to reflect upon these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity.\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is your responsibility to understand and follow Wharton policies regarding academic integrity, including doing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, and adhering to guidance around group work projects. Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Wharton Community Standard. If you have any questions about how to follow these requirements, please contact Julie Nettleton, Director of the Center for Community Standards and Accountability (CSA).\n\n\nCollaboration policy\nOnly work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.\n\nThe homework assignments must be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to homework questions (including any code) with anyone other than myself and the teaching assistants.\nFor the projects, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project across teams.\n\n\n\nPolicy on sharing and reusing code\nI am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. RStudio Community, StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. On individual assignments you may not directly share code with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share code with another team in this class.\n\n\nLate work policy\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework and lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\nHomework and labs may be submitted up to 3 days late. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nThere is no late work accepted for application exercises, since these are designed to help you prepare for labs and homework.\nThe late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email dr. sturdevant before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used for once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let dr. sturdevant know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nRegrade request policy\nRegrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the final project presentations.\n\n\nAttendance policy\nResponsibility for class attendance rests with individual students. Since regular and punctual class attendance is expected, students must accept the consequences of failure to attend. More details on Wharton attendance policies are available here.\nHowever, there may be many reasons why you cannot be in class on a given day, particularly with possible extra personal and academic stress and health concerns this semester. All course lectures will be recorded and available to enrolled students after class. If you miss a lecture, make sure to watch the recording and review the material before the next class session. Given the technologies we use in the course, this is straightforward to do asynchronously. If you know you’re going to miss a class and you’re feeling well enough to do so, notify your teammates ahead of time. Overall these policies are put in place to ensure communication between team members, respect for each others’ time, and also to give you a safety net in the case of illness or other reasons that keep you away from attending class.\n\n\nAttendance policy related to COVID symptoms, exposure, or infection\nStudent health, safety, and well-being are the university’s top priorities. To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have symptoms related to COVID-19, have had a known exposure to COVID-19, or have tested positive for COVID-19. If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health at 215-898-0300. To keep the university community as safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participation in class. For the safety of all students, I require that students wear masks in class and prefer N95 or KN95 masks.\n\n\nInclement weather policy\nIn the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work. This might entail holding the class on Zoom synchronously or watching a recording of the class.\n\n\nPolicy on video recording course content\nLectures will be recorded and available on Canvas, so students should not need to create their own recordings of lectures. If you feel that you need record the lectures yourself, you must get written permission from me ahead of time and these recordings should be used for personal study only, not for distribution. The full policy on recording of lectures falls under the University of Pennsylvania’s V.L. Policy on Unauthorized Copying of Copyrighted Media, available at https://catalog.upenn.edu/faculty-handbook/v/v-l/. Unauthorized distribution may result in a civil suite, criminal charges, and/or penalties and fines."

The reader should be able to fully understand your report without viewing content in the appendix.\n\n\n\nResize figures\nResize plots and figures, so you have more space for the narrative.\n\n\nArranging plots\nArrange plots in a grid, instead of one after the other. This is especially useful when displaying plots for exploratory data analysis and to check assumptions.\nIf you’re using ggplot2 functions, the patchwork package makes it easy to arrange plots in a grid. See the documentation and examples here.\n\n\nPlot titles and axis labels\nBe sure all plot titles and axis labels are visible and easy to read.\n\nUse informative titles, not variable names, for titles and axis labels.\n\n❌ NO! The x-axis is hard to read because the names overlap.\n\nggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = manufacturer)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n✅ YES!

This will also ensure all model coefficients are displayed.\n\nUse the digits argument to display only 3 or 4 significant digits.\nUse the caption argument to add captions to your table.\n\n\n\nmodel <- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)\ntidy(model) %>%\n  kable(digits = 3)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n30.099\n1.634\n18.421\n0\n\n\nhp\n-0.068\n0.010\n-6.742\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuidelines for communicating results\n\nDon’t use variable names in your narrative! Use descriptive terms, so the reader understands your narrative without relying on the data dictionary.\n\n❌ There is a negative linear relationship between mpg and hp.\n✅ There is a negative linear relationship between a car’s fuel economy (in miles per gallon) and its horsepower.\n\nKnow your audience: Your report should be written for a general audience who has an understanding of statistics at the level of STA 210.\nAvoid subject matter jargon: Don’t assume the audience knows all of the specific terminology related to your subject area. If you must use jargon, include a brief definition the first time you introduce a term.\nTell the “so what”: Your report and presentation should be more than a list of interpretations and technical definitions. Focus on what the results mean, i.e. what you want the audience to know about your topic after reading your report or viewing your presentation.\n\n❌ For every one unit increase in horsepower, we expect the miles per gallon to decrease by 0.068 units, on average.\n✅ If the priority is to have good fuel economy, then one should choose a car with lower horsepower. Based on our model, the fuel economy is expected to decrease, on average, by 0.68 miles per gallon for every 10 additional horsepower.\n\nTell a story: All visualizations, tables, model output, and narrative should tell a cohesive story!\nUse one voice: Though multiple people are writing the report, it should read as if it’s from a single author. At least one team member should read through the report before submission to ensure it reads like a cohesive document."

[R is now an internationally recognized language used all over the world](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/technology/business-computing/07program.html). It is possible to do a multitude of advanced computations in R but to keep R nimble, we don’t download all of the things at once.

    "text": "Data: Titanic\nOn April 15, 1912, the largest passenger liner ever made collided with an iceberg during her maiden voyage. When the Titanic sank it killed 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships. One of the reasons that the shipwreck resulted in such loss of life wasthat there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\nThe titanic.csv file contains data for 887 of the real Titanic passengers. Each row represents one person. The columns describe different attributes about the person including whether they survived, their age, their passenger-class, their sex, and the fare they paid\n\nPclass: The class of passengers on the titanic, with \\(1st\\) being the highest class, and \\(3rd\\) the lowest.\nSurvived: A variable that records whether or not a passenger survived the sinking of the titanic.\n\nPart 1: Download and import the data\n\nDownload the file into your Stat1010 R project in the data folder.\nImport your data into R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThis may be a good time to render your document to ensure that the data loads without errors.\n\n\nPart 2: Exploring categorical variables\n\nHow many observations and how many variables in this dataset?\nClassify all the variables into two categories: qualitative or quantitative\nHow many levels of passenger class are there in the variable?\nHow many passengers survived the sinking of the titanic?\nMake a contingency table of class and survival. Which combination of class and survival is the most common?\n\nWhat proportion of \\(3rd\\) class passengers survived?\nWhat proportion of \\(1st\\) class passengers survived?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThis may be a good time to render your document.\n\n\n\nDraw a plot that conditions on class and displays the proportions of each that survived and update labels. What does the plot suggest regarding the chance of survival and your class? Does it suggest that they are associated?\nAssuming Survived and Pclass are independent, write R coding to find the expected counts for all cells of the contingency table. (Hint: you will need to use the rowSums(.[2:3]) and colSums(.[2:4]) functions, depending on the order that you compute the two.)\nPerform a \\(\\chi^2\\) test on the two variables Survived and Pclass.
